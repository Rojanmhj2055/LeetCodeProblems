# Tips for working with array problems

1. Array problems have a simple brute force solution that use O(n) space, but solutions that use same array to reduce space complexity to O(1).
2. Try filling the **array from the back.**
3. Instead deleting an entry, consider **overwriting** it.
4. Be comfortable with writing code that operates on **subarrays**.
5. **off by 1** is easy error to make with catastrophic consequences.
6. Don't worry about integretiy of array (sort, keeping equal entries together), until it is time to return.
